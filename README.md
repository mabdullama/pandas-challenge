# School Performance Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of school performance based on student and school data. The analysis explores various factors that influence academic outcomes, such as budget per student, school size, and school type. 

## Data

The analysis utilizes two main datasets: 

1. `schools.csv` - This dataset provides information about different schools, including their names, types, and sizes.

2. `students.csv` - This dataset contains student-specific data, such as their names, grade levels, test scores, and school affiliations.

## Analysis

The analysis consists of two main parts:

1. Calculation and Summary: The first part of the analysis involves calculating various metrics, such as the total number of schools, total number of students, average test scores, and percentage of students passing math and reading. A summary of these calculations is provided to offer an overview of the dataset.

2. Insights and Conclusions: The second part of the analysis draws two key conclusions from the calculations. It compares the impact of budget per student on the overall passing rate and examines the relationship between school size and the overall passing rate.

## Conclusions

The analysis reveals the following key findings:

1. Budget per Student and Overall Passing Rate: Schools with smaller budgets per student tend to have higher overall passing rates. This highlights the importance of effective resource allocation and suggests that smaller class sizes can positively impact student achievement.

2. School Size and Overall Passing Rate: Smaller and medium-sized schools (with fewer than 2000 students) tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools. This emphasizes the benefits of smaller class sizes and personalized attention in improving academic performance.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the analysis script:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
